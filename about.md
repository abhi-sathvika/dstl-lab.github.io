I am Sam Lau, a Ph.D. candidate advised by [Philip Guo][pg]{:target="\_blank"}
in the Cognitive Science department at UC San Diego. I study human-computer
interaction (HCI), where I prototype new software for programming, statistics,
and data science instructors to prepare their lessons.

This work draws on recent advances in direct manipulation
interfaces, creative authoring tools, and data visualization.

In the past, I was a computer science student at UC Berkeley where I helped
launch Data 8 and Data 100, Berkeley's two flagship data science courses. My
instructor ratings are available on [the HKN
website][ratings]{:target="\_blank"}. I also wrote a textbook for Data 100,
which is [freely available online][textbook]{:target="\_blank"}.
